      <!--About Me-->
      <h2>I'm Marvin!</h2>
      <p>I am an aspiring Software Developer living in Dallas, Texas.</p>
      
        <p>At this point in my career i'm looking for a new team to thrive in. One where I can grow my skills and learn from those around me. One where I'm pushed to pick up new skills and and sharpen existing ones. To be totally honest I'm looking for the same opportunity my manager gave me. A chance to come in and show I have what it takes.</p>
      <p>Outside of my interest in Software Development I love video games. When I'm not working or working through my Thinkful Modules you can probably find me playing some sort of RPG. I'm big on playing games that have storylines that can be followed and love playing games where your decisions effect the ultimate outcome.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Growing up I had no idea what a career in Tech could look like until I got introduced to recruiting in 2020 and I originally I thought that my career would be just that. I found nothing more interesting than talking to government employees that worked for the DHS and other Defense contractors about the super cool programs they could talk to me about and when the clearance stopped them from telling me to much I'll be honest and say that I still felt pretty important. Fast forward to now and here we are, taking that leap of faith, hoping that my dream of becoming an engineer one day comes true. My journey begins with Thinkful... but I know it doesnt stop here.</p>
